# Redis OM + Express Workshop Starter Code

This is the wonderful and amazing repository for my Redis OM + Express Workshop. The workshop might well be done in person, but it's also written up as a tutorial on [redis.io](https://redis.io/docs/stack/get-started/tutorials/stack-node/) and in convenient video form on YouTube linked below!

Everything you need to know to use this repository is in the tutorial and the video. Or—if I'm doing this workshop in person—in my head! If I'm not there or I'm a liar, feel free to ask in the comments on YouTube, open an issue on this repo, or—best of all—hop on our Discord server at [discord.gg/redis](https://discord.gg/redis) and ask there.

Thanks for using my code and I sincerely hope you find it useful.
